# Bethlehem Web UI

The front end for [Bethlehem](https://github.com/gregoryjjb/bethlehem). View the [live demo site here](https://relaxed-austin-5bfa65.netlify.com/). You can't play shows (since there's no lights hooked up to it) but you can view the projects in the [editor](https://relaxed-austin-5bfa65.netlify.com/editor).
